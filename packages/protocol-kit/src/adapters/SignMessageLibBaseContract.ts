/**
 * Abstract class SignMessageLibBaseContract serves as a base for creating a SignMessageLibBaseContract contract for a specific adapter (Ethers.js, Web3.js, or viem.js)
 * This class is designed to be extended by adapter-specific abstract classes, such as SignMessageLibBaseContractEthers, SignMessageLibBaseContractWeb3, and SignMessageLibBaseContractViem.
 * It includes the core logic for selecting the appropriate ABI and the address from SignMessageLib deployments.
 *
 * @template SignMessageLibContractAbiType - The ABI associated with the SignMessageLib contract.
 *
 * Example subclasses extending this base class:
 * - SignMessageLibBaseContractEthers<SignMessageLibContract_v1_3_0_Abi> extends SignMessageLibBaseContract<SignMessageLibContract_v1_3_0_Abi>
 * - SignMessageLibBaseContractWeb3<SignMessageLibContract_v1_3_0_Abi> extends SignMessageLibBaseContract<SignMessageLibContract_v1_3_0_Abi>
 * - SignMessageLibBaseContractViem<SignMessageLibContract_v1_3_0_Abi> extends SignMessageLibBaseContract<SignMessageLibContract_v1_3_0_Abi>
