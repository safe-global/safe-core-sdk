# Support Guidelines

We appreciate your interest in our project. If you have questions, need help, or encounter issues, please follow these guidelines:

1. **GitHub Issues**: **Do not** use GitHub issues for general support or questions. Issues are primarily for bug reports, feature requests, and discussions related to code changes.

2. **Stack Exchange**: For support-related questions, we recommend using [Stack Exchange with the appropriate tags](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/safe-core). The **safe-core** tag should always be included. Many community members and experts monitor Stack Exchange and can provide timely assistance.

3. **Search First**: Before posting a new question, search existing issues and Stack Exchange to see if your question has already been answered. You might find a solution without waiting for a response.

4. **Be Specific**: When asking for help, provide as much context as possible. Include relevant details such as error messages, steps to reproduce, testing addresses, and the version of our project packages you're using.

5. **Be Respectful**: Treat others with kindness and respect. We're all here to learn and help each other.

## Getting Help

If you need assistance, follow these steps:

1. **Documentation**: Refer to our [project's documentation](https://docs.safe.global/sdk/overview) for usage instructions, FAQs, and troubleshooting tips.

2. **Stack Exchange**: Search for existing answers or ask a new question on Stack Exchange. Use relevant tags as **safe-core**.

Remember that GitHub issues are not the right place for general support. Let's keep our issue tracker focused on improving the project! ðŸ˜Š
