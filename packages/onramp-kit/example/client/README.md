# How to use

This is an example of how to use the `@safe-global/onramp-kit` package.

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

This example can be used as a playground to test the package as it is relatively imported from the root of the project.

```typescript
import { SafeOnRampKit, SafeOnRampProviderType } from '../../src/index'
```
