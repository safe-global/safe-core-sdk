# ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

This package is provided for testing purposes only. It's not ready for production use. We are working with Stripe and participating in the pilot test for their new [crypto on-ramp](https://stripe.com/es/blog/crypto-onramp). Considering this, we provide a public key and a testing server already configured during the [Safe Account Abstraction hackathon](https://gnosis-safe.notion.site/Safe-d6c6ed61389041e28f5c7c925f653701)

Once the hackathon and Stripe pilot are over, the server will be removed and you should use your own keys and server in case you opt-in for the [StripePack](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/packages/onramp-kit/src/packs/stripe/StripePack.ts).
