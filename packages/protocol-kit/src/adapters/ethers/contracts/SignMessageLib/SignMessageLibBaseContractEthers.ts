/**
 * Abstract class SignMessageLibBaseContractEthers extends SignMessageLibBaseContract to specifically integrate with the Ethers.js v6 library.
 * It is designed to be instantiated for different versions of the SignMessageLib contract.
 *
 * This abstract class sets up the Ethers v6 Contract object that interacts with a SignMessageLib contract version.
 *
 * Subclasses of SignMessageLibBaseContractEthers are expected to represent specific versions of the SignMessageLib contract.
 *
 * @template SignMessageLibContractAbiType - The ABI type specific to the version of the SignMessageLib contract, extending InterfaceAbi from Ethers.
 * @extends SignMessageLibBaseContract<SignMessageLibContractAbiType> - Extends the generic SignMessageLibBaseContract with Ethers-specific implementation.
 *
 * Example subclasses:
 * - SignMessageLibContract_v1_4_1_Ethers extends SignMessageLibBaseContractEthers<SignMessageLibContract_v1_4_1_Abi>
 * - SignMessageLibContract_v1_3_0_Ethers extends SignMessageLibBaseContractEthers<SignMessageLibContract_v1_3_0_Abi>
