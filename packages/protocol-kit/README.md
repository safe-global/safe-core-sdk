## Documentation

Head to the [Protocol Kit docs](https://docs.safe.global/sdk/protocol-kit) to learn more about how to use this SDK.

## Installation

Install the package with yarn or npm:

```bash
yarn add @safe-global/protocol-kit
npm install @safe-global/protocol-kit
```

## Quick Start

- `provider`: You can set an EIP-1193 compatible provider or an HTTP/WebSocket RPC URL.
- `signer`: This is an optional parameter. It should be the provider's address you want to use or a private key. If not set, it will try to fetch a connected account from the provider.

Loading an already deployed Safe, using the `safeAddress` property:

```js
import Safe from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'

const protocolKit = await Safe.init({
  provider,
  signer,
  safeAddress
})
```

Initialization of an undeployed Safe using the `predictedSafe` property. Because Safes are deployed in a deterministic way, passing a `predictedSafe` will allow to initialize the SDK with the Safe configuration and use it to some extent before it's deployed:

```js
import Safe, { PredictedSafeProps } from '@safe-global/protocol-kit'

const predictedSafe: PredictedSafeProps = {
  safeAccountConfig,
  safeDeploymentConfig
}

const protocolKit = await Safe.init({
  provider,
  signer,
  predictedSafe
})
```
