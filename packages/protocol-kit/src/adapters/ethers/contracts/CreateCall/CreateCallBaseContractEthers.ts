 * Abstract class CreateCallBaseContractEthers extends CreateCallBaseContract to specifically integrate with the Ethers.js v6 library.
 * It is designed to be instantiated for different versions of the Safe contract.
 *
 * This abstract class sets up the Ethers v6 Contract object that interacts with a CreateCall contract version.
 *
 * Subclasses of CreateCallBaseContractEthers are expected to represent specific versions of the contract.
 *
 * @template CreateCallContractAbiType - The ABI type specific to the version of the CreateCall contract, extending InterfaceAbi from Ethers.
 * @extends CreateCallBaseContract<CreateCallContractAbiType> - Extends the generic CreateCallBaseContract with Ethers-specific implementation.
 *
 * Example subclasses:
 * - CreateCallContract_v1_4_1_Ethers extends CreateCallBaseContractEthers<CreateCallContract_v1_4_1_Abi>
 * - CreateCallContract_v1_3_0_Ethers extends CreateCallBaseContractEthers<CreateCallContract_v1_3_0_Abi>
