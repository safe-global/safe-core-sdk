/**
 * Abstract class SafeProxyFactoryBaseContractEthers extends SafeProxyFactoryBaseContract to specifically integrate with the Ethers.js v6 library.
 * It is designed to be instantiated for different versions of the Safe contract.
 *
 * This abstract class sets up the Ethers v6 Contract object that interacts with a Safe Proxy Factory contract version.
 *
 * Subclasses of SafeProxyFactoryBaseContractEthers are expected to represent specific versions of the contract.
 *
 * @template SafeProxyFactoryContractAbiType - The ABI type specific to the version of the Safe Proxy Factory contract, extending InterfaceAbi from Ethers.
 * @extends SafeProxyFactoryBaseContract<SafeProxyFactoryContractAbiType> - Extends the generic SafeProxyFactoryBaseContract with Ethers-specific implementation.
 *
 * Example subclasses:
 * - SafeProxyFactoryContract_v1_4_1_Ethers extends SafeProxyFactoryBaseContractEthers<SafeProxyFactoryContract_v1_4_1_Abi>
 * - SafeProxyFactoryContract_v1_3_0_Ethers extends SafeProxyFactoryBaseContractEthers<SafeProxyFactoryContract_v1_3_0_Abi>
 * - SafeProxyFactoryContract_v1_2_0_Ethers extends SafeProxyFactoryBaseContractEthers<SafeProxyFactoryContract_v1_2_0_Abi>
 * - SafeProxyFactoryContract_v1_1_1_Ethers extends SafeProxyFactoryBaseContractEthers<SafeProxyFactoryContract_v1_1_1_Abi>
 * - SafeProxyFactoryContract_v1_0_0_Ethers extends SafeProxyFactoryBaseContractEthers<SafeProxyFactoryContract_v1_0_0_Abi>
